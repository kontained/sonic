# Sonic Exercise
Please have a look in the **Sonic.DTO.Basic** namespace for my solution to the exercise. This is the 'minimum' solution that statisfies the requirements.

Additionally, I've expanded upon the concepts laid out in the exercise. You can see that in the **Sonic.*.Extended** namespace.

I took some liberties in terms to the original design that was in the document, but I hope that it'll give you better insight into how I'd approach the problem.

In the 'extended' version I've pulled the business logic out of the DTO's and into it's own layer.

I'm using Xunit as the unit testing framework, and Moq for the Mocking library.
